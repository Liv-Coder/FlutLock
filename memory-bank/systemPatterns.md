# System Patterns: FlutLock

## Architecture Overview

FlutLock follows a modular command-line utility architecture with these components:

- Core automation script as the entry point
- Modular functions for specific tasks (keystore handling, property files, build commands)
- Secure credential management system
- Verification module for signing validation

## Key Technical Decisions

- Python as implementation language for cross-platform compatibility
- Command-line interface first, with potential for GUI in future versions
- Environment variables as primary method for secure credential passing
- Modular design to enable future integrations (Fastlane, Play Store API)

## Design Patterns

- Command pattern for executing different build operations
- Strategy pattern for handling different keystore scenarios (new vs. existing)
- Factory pattern for generating different output formats (APK vs. AAB)
- Facade pattern to simplify the complex signing workflow

## Component Relationships

```
[CLI Interface] → [Configuration Manager] → [Keystore Handler]
                                         ↓
[Flutter Build Commands] ← [Property File Generator]
          ↓
[Signature Verification] → [Output Reporting]
```

## Future Design Considerations

- Plugin architecture for custom build steps
- Integration points with CI/CD systems
- Service layer for cloud keystores
- Adapter pattern for different deployment targets
