# Active Context: FlutLock

## Current Work Focus

The current development focus has been on completing the short-term sprint tasks and preparing for medium-term feature developments. Major accomplishments include implementing support for custom signing configuration names in build.gradle, improving error handling and user feedback mechanisms, creating detailed documentation for all configuration options, and establishing a robust cross-platform testing infrastructure that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

The next development phase will focus on implementing Flutter flavor support, which builds upon the custom signing configuration work. This will allow for different build variants (development, staging, production) with their own signing configurations and settings.

Major components of the current and upcoming work include:

- Custom signing configuration names in build.gradle for different environments
- Enhanced exception handling with detailed troubleshooting suggestions
- Comprehensive documentation for all configuration options with examples
- Cross-platform testing infrastructure with GitHub Actions
- Flutter flavor support for different build variants
- Preparation for integrations with external services (Play Store API, Fastlane)

## Recent Changes

- Added support for custom signing configuration names in build.gradle:

  - Updated main.py to add a new CLI parameter for specifying custom signing configuration name
  - Modified gradle.py to support custom signing configuration names
  - Created examples demonstrating custom signing configuration usage

- Improved error handling and user feedback:

  - Enhanced exception classes with more descriptive docstrings and troubleshooting information
  - Added a new GradleError exception class for better error categorization
  - Improved error messages throughout the codebase
  - Added detailed troubleshooting guidance for different error types
  - Implemented better feedback for successful operations

- Added detailed documentation for all configuration options:

  - Created a comprehensive configuration.md document in the docs directory
  - Documented all configuration options with examples
  - Added information about the new custom signing configuration feature
  - Included examples of different configuration scenarios

- Set up cross-platform testing:

  - Created a GitHub Actions workflow that runs tests on Windows, macOS, and Linux
  - Added tests for custom signing configuration functionality
  - Created documentation explaining how to run tests across platforms
  - Set up infrastructure for continuous integration testing on all platforms

- Previous codebase cleanup completed:
  - Removed redundant utils/config.py as its functionality is covered by config_processor.py
  - Removed unused CLI entry point file (src/flutter_signer/cli.py)
  - Simplified legacy scripts to forward to the new package structure
  - Removed duplicate example scripts
  - Updated the main README with a clearer project structure description
  - Added version information to the root flutlock script

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate (Current Sprint):**

   - ✅ Test the package installation and functionality
   - ✅ Verify that the command-line entry point works as expected
   - ✅ Ensure all imports are correctly resolved
   - ✅ Confirm backward compatibility with existing scripts
   - ✅ Test the build.gradle modification functionality in real projects
   - ✅ Test the configuration variable substitution with different environments
   - ✅ Enhance error handling for edge cases in Gradle file modifications
   - ✅ Clean up duplicate and unwanted code
   - ✅ Add support for custom signing configuration names in build.gradle
   - ✅ Improve error handling and user feedback
   - ✅ Add detailed documentation for all configuration options
   - ✅ Run a complete test suite across multiple platforms

2. **Short-term (Next Sprint):**

   - Implement Flutter flavor support for different build variants
   - Add mapping between flavors and signing configurations
   - Enhance documentation with flavor-specific examples
   - Improve error handling for flavor-specific scenarios
   - Increase test coverage for new features
   - Update example scripts to demonstrate flavor functionality

3. **Medium-term (Future Milestones):**
   - Implement Play Store API integration
   - Add support for cloud keystore management
   - Create a configuration file wizard
   - Enhance documentation with tutorials and guides
   - Add a schema-based validation system for configuration files
   - Integrate with Fastlane for additional deployment options

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- **Custom Signing Configurations:** We've implemented support for custom signing configuration names in build.gradle, which allows for more flexible build configurations. This lays the groundwork for future Flutter flavor support.

- **Error Handling Strategy:** We've enhanced error handling with detailed troubleshooting suggestions to improve the user experience. Each exception class now includes specific guidance based on the error type.

- **Documentation Approach:** We've created comprehensive documentation for all configuration options, making it easier for users to understand and utilize the tool's capabilities.

- **Testing Infrastructure:** We've established a cross-platform testing infrastructure with GitHub Actions, ensuring that FlutLock works consistently across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

- **Package Structure:** We're maintaining the package-based architecture with clear separation of concerns, following modern Python package best practices.

- **Entry Points:** We're using console_scripts in setup.py to create the `flutlock` command, which calls the main function in the cli module.

- **Backward Compatibility:** We've preserved the original script in the examples directory and ensured that the new structure doesn't break existing functionality.

- **Gradle Management:** We've implemented automatic modification of build.gradle files with an opt-out option, allowing users to skip this step if they prefer to manage Gradle files manually.

- **Configuration Processing:** We're using a flexible approach to configuration with variable substitution and default values, making it easier to use the same configuration across different environments.

The primary goal is to continue improving the tool's flexibility and user experience while ensuring reliable operation across different platforms and project configurations.
