# Active Context: FlutLock

## Current Work Focus

The current development focus has been on enhancing the FlutLock tool with advanced configuration processing capabilities. This includes implementing variable substitution in JSON configuration files, allowing for more flexible and powerful configuration options. This enhancement makes the tool more adaptable to different environments and deployment scenarios.

Major components of this enhancement include:

- Creating a new `config_processor.py` module in the utils package to handle enhanced configuration
- Implementing variable substitution using ${VAR_NAME} syntax in JSON files
- Supporting default values for variables with ${VAR_NAME:-default} syntax
- Adding environment-specific configuration management
- Ensuring cross-platform compatibility with path normalization
- Providing comprehensive validation of configuration files
- Creating example scripts demonstrating environment-specific configurations

This work builds upon the previous enhancements to the build.gradle modification feature, creating a more complete and powerful automation solution.

## Recent Changes

- Created a standard Python package structure with `src/flutter_signer` as the main package
- Organized the codebase into core, utils, and integrations modules

- Updated `setup.py` to include console_scripts entry points
- Created `config`, `docs`, and `examples` directories for better organization
- Updated documentation to reflect the new structure
- Modified `MANIFEST.in` to include all necessary files
- Moved the original `sign_flutter_app.py` script to the `examples` directory for backward compatibility
- Moved the `legacy_sign_flutter_app.py` script to the `examples` directory

- Enhanced test coverage:
  - Added unit tests for the CLI module
  - Updated tests to work with the new package structure
- Improved CI/CD workflow:
  - Updated GitHub Actions workflow to reflect the new directory structure
  - Fixed the test coverage path to work with the new package organization
  - Ensured CI builds properly run all tests across multiple platforms
- Added build.gradle modification functionality:
  - Created new gradle.py module in the core package
  - Implemented support for both Kotlin DSL and Groovy DSL
  - Added command-line options to control this feature
  - Added tests for the new functionality
  - Updated documentation to describe the new feature
- Implemented enhanced configuration processing:
  - Created new config_processor.py module for advanced configuration handling
  - Added support for variable substitution in JSON configuration files
  - Implemented default values for variables that aren't set
  - Added special variables like PROJECT_DIR and APP_NAME
  - Ensured cross-platform compatibility with path normalization
  - Created comprehensive validation for configuration files
  - Added detailed error reporting for configuration issues
  - Created an optimized example script showing environment-specific configurations
- Cleaned up duplicate and unwanted code:
  - Removed redundant utils/config.py as its functionality is covered by config_processor.py
  - Removed unused CLI entry point file (src/flutter_signer/cli.py)
  - Simplified the legacy scripts to forward to the new package structure
  - Removed duplicate example scripts
  - Updated the main README with a clearer project structure description
  - Added version information to the root flutlock script

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate (Current Sprint):**

   - ✅ Test the package installation and functionality
   - ✅ Verify that the command-line entry point works as expected
   - ✅ Ensure all imports are correctly resolved
   - ✅ Confirm backward compatibility with existing scripts
   - ✅ Test the build.gradle modification functionality in real projects
   - ✅ Test the configuration variable substitution with different environments
   - ✅ Enhance error handling for edge cases in Gradle file modifications
   - ✅ Clean up duplicate and unwanted code

2. **Short-term (Next Sprint):**

   - ✅ Add comprehensive unit tests for the restructured codebase
   - ✅ Set up continuous integration for the project
   - ✅ Create more example scripts for common use cases
   - ✅ Implement variable substitution in JSON configuration
   - ✅ Support environment-specific configurations
   - Improve error handling and user feedback
   - Run a complete test suite across multiple platforms
   - Add detailed documentation for all configuration options
   - Add support for custom signing configuration names in build.gradle

3. **Medium-term (Future Milestones):**
   - Implement Play Store API integration
   - Add support for cloud keystore management
   - Create a configuration file wizard
   - Enhance documentation with tutorials and guides
   - Support for Flutter flavor-specific signing configurations
   - Add a schema-based validation system for configuration files

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- **Package Structure:** We've decided to use a `src/` layout to follow modern Python package best practices, providing clear separation between package code and support files.

- **Entry Points:** We're using console_scripts in setup.py to create the `flutlock` command, which calls the main function in the cli module.

- **Backward Compatibility:** To maintain compatibility with existing workflows, we've preserved the original script in the examples directory and ensured that the new structure doesn't break existing functionality.

- **Documentation Strategy:** We're moving all documentation to the `docs/` directory and enhancing it to reflect the new structure, with clear instructions for both new and existing users.

- **Configuration Management:** We're standardizing configuration file formats and moving examples to the `config/` directory to provide clear guidance on configuration options.

- **Gradle Management:** We've implemented automatic modification of build.gradle files with an opt-out option, allowing users to skip this step if they prefer to manage Gradle files manually.

- **Configuration Processing:** We're using a flexible approach to configuration with variable substitution and default values, making it easier to use the same configuration across different environments.

The primary goal is to improve maintainability and extensibility while ensuring that existing users can smoothly transition to the new structure and functionality.
