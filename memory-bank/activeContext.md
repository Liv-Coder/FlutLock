# Active Context: FlutLock

## Current Work Focus

The project is in its implementation phase. We have set up the foundation of the FlutLock tool, created the core Python script, and added examples for various use cases. The focus is now on:

- Testing the script with various Flutter projects
- Ensuring cross-platform compatibility
- Adding more robust error handling
- Preparing for distribution
- Setting up GitHub branch strategy and CI/CD workflows

## Recent Changes

- Created project structure with basic files (.gitignore, LICENSE, README.md)
- Set up GitHub workflow for CI
- Implemented core Python script with all required functionality
- Added test script for basic functionality validation
- Created examples for different usage scenarios:
  - CI/CD integration examples
  - Windows batch file example
  - Bash script example
- Added detailed CI/CD integration guide
- Established Git branching strategy with main (stable) and development branches
- Enhanced GitHub Actions workflow to support both branches with appropriate CI/CD steps
- Added JSON configuration file support for non-interactive operation

## Next Steps

1. Test the script with real Flutter projects
2. Add more robust error handling for edge cases
3. Create unit and integration tests
4. Prepare for packaging and distribution
5. Consider configuration file support
6. Plan for version 1.x enhancements
7. Complete CI/CD pipeline integration

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- **Password Handling**: Using environment variables and secure password input to avoid exposing credentials
- **Path Handling**: Using relative paths where possible for portability between environments
- **Error Reporting**: Focusing on clear, actionable error messages
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Using pathlib and os.path for platform-agnostic file operations
- **CI/CD Integration**: Providing examples for popular CI/CD platforms
- **Testing Strategy**: Created test script to validate functionality in various environments
- **Branch Strategy**:
  - `main` branch contains stable, production-ready code
  - `development` branch for ongoing development and integration
  - Feature branches should be created from and merged back to `development`
  - Only merge to `main` when features are fully tested and ready for release
- **Configuration**: Supporting both interactive input and JSON configuration files to accommodate various workflows
