# Active Context: FlutLock

## Current Work Focus

The project is in its implementation phase. We have set up the foundation of the FlutLock tool, created the core Python script, and added examples for various use cases. The focus is now on:

- Testing the script with various Flutter projects
- Ensuring cross-platform compatibility
- Adding more robust error handling
- Preparing for distribution

## Recent Changes

- Created project structure with basic files (.gitignore, LICENSE, README.md)
- Set up GitHub workflow for CI
- Implemented core Python script with all required functionality
- Added test script for basic functionality validation
- Created examples for different usage scenarios:
  - CI/CD integration examples
  - Windows batch file example
  - Bash script example
- Added detailed CI/CD integration guide

## Next Steps

1. Test the script with real Flutter projects
2. Add more robust error handling for edge cases
3. Create unit and integration tests
4. Prepare for packaging and distribution
5. Consider configuration file support
6. Plan for version 1.x enhancements

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- **Password Handling**: Using environment variables and secure password input to avoid exposing credentials
- **Path Handling**: Using relative paths where possible for portability between environments
- **Error Reporting**: Focusing on clear, actionable error messages
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Using pathlib and os.path for platform-agnostic file operations
- **CI/CD Integration**: Providing examples for popular CI/CD platforms
- **Testing Strategy**: Created test script to validate functionality in various environments
