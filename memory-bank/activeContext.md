# Active Context: FlutLock

## Current Work Focus

The current development focus is on restructuring the FlutLock project to follow a proper Python package structure. This effort involves organizing the code into appropriate directories, creating a proper package structure, and ensuring that the tool can be installed and used easily.

Major components of this restructuring include:

- Organizing source code in a `src/flutter_signer` directory with clear module boundaries
- Creating proper entry points for the CLI command via `setup.py`
- Moving configuration files, documentation, and examples to their respective directories
- Updating MANIFEST.in to ensure all needed files are included in the package
- Maintaining backward compatibility with existing workflows

## Recent Changes

- Created a standard Python package structure with `src/flutter_signer` as the main package
- Organized the codebase into core, utils, and integrations modules
- Added entry point script `flutlock` for command-line usage
- Updated `setup.py` to include console_scripts entry points
- Created `config`, `docs`, and `examples` directories for better organization
- Updated documentation to reflect the new structure
- Modified `MANIFEST.in` to include all necessary files
- Moved the original `sign_flutter_app.py` script to the `examples` directory for backward compatibility
- Moved the `legacy_sign_flutter_app.py` script to the `examples` directory
- Kept configuration files (`pyproject.toml`, `MANIFEST.in`, `setup.py`) at the root level
- Ensured the `flutlock` CLI entry point remains at the root level for easy access
- Fixed Pylint warnings in multiple files:
  - Added explicit UTF-8 encoding to file operations
  - Fixed import order (standard library before third-party)
  - Renamed variables to follow Python naming conventions
  - Added proper sys.exit() handling in CLI module
  - Ensured consistent import practices across the codebase
- Fixed encoding issues:
  - Corrected UTF-8 encoding problems in legacy script files
  - Ensured all Python files use consistent encoding
- Added new example scripts to demonstrate common use cases:
  - CI/CD integration with non-interactive mode and environment variables
  - Configuration file-based usage with JSON
- Enhanced test coverage:
  - Added unit tests for the CLI module
  - Updated tests to work with the new package structure
- Improved CI/CD workflow:
  - Updated GitHub Actions workflow to reflect the new directory structure
  - Fixed the test coverage path to work with the new package organization
  - Ensured CI builds properly run all tests across multiple platforms

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate (Current Sprint):**

   - ✅ Test the package installation and functionality
   - ✅ Verify that the command-line entry point works as expected
   - ✅ Ensure all imports are correctly resolved
   - ✅ Confirm backward compatibility with existing scripts

2. **Short-term (Next Sprint):**

   - ✅ Add comprehensive unit tests for the restructured codebase
   - ✅ Set up continuous integration for the project
   - ✅ Create more example scripts for common use cases
   - Improve error handling and user feedback
   - Run a complete test suite across multiple platforms
   - Add detailed documentation for all configuration options

3. **Medium-term (Future Milestones):**
   - Implement Play Store API integration
   - Add support for cloud keystore management
   - Create a configuration file wizard
   - Enhance documentation with tutorials and guides

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- **Package Structure:** We've decided to use a `src/` layout to follow modern Python package best practices, providing clear separation between package code and support files.

- **Entry Points:** We're using console_scripts in setup.py to create the `flutlock` command, which calls the main function in the cli module.

- **Backward Compatibility:** To maintain compatibility with existing workflows, we've preserved the original script in the examples directory and ensured that the new structure doesn't break existing functionality.

- **Documentation Strategy:** We're moving all documentation to the `docs/` directory and enhancing it to reflect the new structure, with clear instructions for both new and existing users.

- **Configuration Management:** We're standardizing configuration file formats and moving examples to the `config/` directory to provide clear guidance on configuration options.

The primary goal is to improve maintainability and extensibility while ensuring that existing users can smoothly transition to the new structure.
