## Current Status

Implementation is complete for Version 1.x with comprehensive testing, packaging, and CI/CD integration. The tool has been enhanced with robust error handling including custom exception classes, detailed error messages, troubleshooting suggestions, and fallback mechanisms. All core functionality has been implemented and extensively tested on multiple platforms.

The project follows a package-based architecture with clean separation of concerns, improving maintainability and testability. Code is organized into logical modules (core, utils, integrations) with clear interfaces between them. This architecture facilitates future extensions and integrations planned for Version 2.0.

The most recent enhancements include:

1. **Custom signing configuration names in build.gradle**:

   - Added support for specifying custom names for signing configurations
   - Created a new CLI parameter (--signing-config-name)
   - Updated the Gradle file modification logic to use custom names
   - Added example script demonstrating the feature

2. **Enhanced error handling and user feedback**:

   - Improved exception classes with detailed troubleshooting suggestions
   - Added a new GradleError class for better error categorization
   - Enhanced error messages throughout the codebase
   - Implemented more descriptive user feedback

3. **Comprehensive documentation**:

   - Created detailed documentation for all configuration options
   - Added examples for different configuration scenarios
   - Documented the custom signing configuration feature
   - Updated examples README with new features

4. **Cross-platform testing infrastructure**:
   - Set up GitHub Actions workflow for testing on Windows, macOS, and Linux
   - Added tests for different Python versions
   - Created platform-specific setup steps for dependencies
   - Added documentation for running tests across platforms

The tool is now ready for real-world usage with both interactive and non-interactive modes, making it suitable for development environments and CI/CD pipelines. The next phase of development will focus on Version 2.0 features, starting with Flutter flavor support, which builds on the custom signing configuration functionality.

## Known Issues

- Edge cases in password handling need further testing
- Some error scenarios may still need additional handling:
  - Network issues during builds
  - File permission problems on different platforms
  - Handling of special characters in paths and keystore information
- Some imports may need adjustment as the package structure evolves
- Complex Gradle files with custom formatting may not be correctly modified
- Gradle modification could be improved to support Flutter flavors
- Environment variable default values processing might need improvement
- Testing on Windows platforms may require additional path normalization in some areas
- CI workflow might need adjustments for specific platform dependencies
