## Current Status

Implementation complete for Version 1.0 with comprehensive testing, packaging, and CI/CD integration. The tool has been enhanced with robust error handling including custom exception classes, detailed error messages, and fallback mechanisms. All core functionality has been implemented and extensively tested on multiple platforms.

The project has been restructured to follow package-based architecture with clean separation of concerns, improving maintainability and testability. Code is now organized into logical modules (core, utils, integrations) with clear interfaces between them. This restructuring also facilitates future extensions and integrations planned for Version 2.0.

The tool is now ready for real-world usage with both interactive and non-interactive modes, making it suitable for development environments and CI/CD pipelines. The next phase of development will focus on Version 2.0 features including integration with additional tools and support for more advanced build scenarios.

The project has been successfully restructured as a proper Python package with appropriate directory structure and entry points. The core functionality has been maintained while making it more maintainable and extendable.

Most recently, significant new features have been added:

1. Automatic modification of build.gradle.kts/build.gradle files to include signing configurations, eliminating the need for manual editing of Gradle files.

2. Enhanced configuration processing with variable substitution, allowing for more flexible and powerful JSON configuration files:
   - Support for environment variables in config files using ${VAR_NAME} syntax
   - Default values for variables using ${VAR_NAME:-default} syntax
   - Special variables like ${PROJECT_DIR} and ${APP_NAME} for path handling
   - Cross-platform path normalization for Windows compatibility
   - Environment-specific configuration handling (dev/staging/prod)

Key improvements include:

- Proper separation of concerns with modular code organization
- Improved documentation and examples
- Command-line entry point using standard Python packaging
- Backward compatibility with existing scripts and workflows
- Original script and legacy compatibility script moved to examples directory
- Well-defined location for package-level files (root directory) and source code (src directory)
- Configuration files kept at the root level for standard Python packaging practices
- Automatic modification of build.gradle files with signing configurations
- Variable substitution in configuration files for flexible settings
- Environment-specific configuration handling
- All components verified to work together properly:
  - Package installation functioning correctly
  - Command-line entry point working as expected
  - Example and legacy scripts running properly
  - Proper error handling and exit codes throughout the codebase
  - Gradle file modification working as expected
  - Configuration variable substitution working as expected
- Enhanced test coverage for critical components:
  - CLI module fully tested
  - Configuration handling thoroughly verified
  - Keystore and key.properties generation tested
  - build.gradle modification tested with both Kotlin and Groovy DSL
  - Configuration processing and variable substitution tested
- New example scripts that demonstrate:
  - CI/CD integration
  - Configuration file usage
  - Environment-specific configuration
  - Basic library usage
- Updated CI/CD workflow that supports the new package structure:
  - Cross-platform testing (Windows, macOS, Linux)
  - Multiple Python version testing (3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10)
  - Proper testing of package code coverage

The next development phase should focus on extending functionality, improving test coverage, and adding CI/CD workflows, as well as enhancing the build.gradle modification feature with support for custom signing configuration names and Flutter flavors.

## Known Issues

- Edge cases in password handling need further testing
- Some error scenarios may still need additional handling:
  - Network issues during builds
  - File permission problems on different platforms
  - Handling of special characters in paths and keystore information
- Need to verify Windows compatibility for all commands
- Additional error handling needed for edge cases
- Documentation needs to be expanded with more examples
- Some imports may need adjustment as the package structure evolves
- Most Pylint warnings have been addressed, but some may remain in newly added or modified files
- Complex Gradle files with custom formatting may not be correctly modified
- Gradle modification could be improved to support Flutter flavors
- Environment variable default values processing might need improvement
