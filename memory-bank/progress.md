# Project Progress: FlutLock

## What Works

- Initial project planning completed
- Roadmap defined with clear version milestones
- Project architecture and folder structure implemented
- Core script functionality implemented:
  - Dependency checking
  - Keystore generation
  - key.properties file creation
  - Flutter build command execution
  - Signature verification
  - Command-line interface
  - JSON configuration file support
- Test script created to validate functionality
- Example scripts for various usage scenarios added
- CI/CD integration guide created
- Git branching strategy implemented (main and development branches)
- GitHub Actions workflow enhanced to support both branches

## Current Status

Implementation phase with examples and testing. Core script functionality has been implemented and example scripts have been created for different usage scenarios. Git branching strategy has been set up with main (stable) and development (ongoing work) branches. GitHub Actions workflow has been enhanced to support both branches. The tool needs comprehensive testing with real Flutter projects to validate its functionality across different environments.

## Known Issues

- Comprehensive testing needed on all platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Need to test with different Flutter project structures
- Security considerations need thorough review
- Edge cases in password handling need further testing
- Error handling could be improved in some areas
